Multi-scale planning:
	1. Here's what I'm working on this quarter.
	2. Here's what I'm working on this month.
	3. Here's what I'm working on this week.
	4. Here's what I'm working on today.
	This helps you see the whole ball-game and make sure you're not running around randomly

Doubling heuristics:
	1. Whatever list you think is reasonable to do today? -> Cut in half!
	2. However much time you think it will take to do a project? -> Double it!

Timeblock plan:
	Force yourself to make decisions on what exactly you should be doing given the time available
